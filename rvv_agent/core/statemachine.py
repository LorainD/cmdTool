"""core.statemachine — State-machine engine for the migration pipeline.

Drives ``TaskContext`` through its state transitions.  Each state has a
registered handler function with signature ``(TaskContext) -> TaskContext``.
The handler is responsible for:
  1. Executing the stage logic (LLM calls, tool invocations, user prompts).
  2. Persisting its artifact via ``task.save_artifact()``.
  3. Setting ``task.current_state`` to the next state.

The engine calls ``task.save()`` after every handler returns, so the task
manifest is always up-to-date on disk and can be resumed after a crash.
